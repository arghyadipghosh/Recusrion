Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.
You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.








#include<iostream>
#include "Solution.h"
using namespace std;


int lastIndex(int input[], int size, int x) {
  /* Don't write main().
     Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     Return output and don't print it.
     Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
  */
  
  if(input[size-1]==x)
  {
      return size-1;
  }
    if(size==0)
    {
        return -1;
    }
    return lastIndex(input,size-1,x);
}


int main(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;
  
    int *input = new int[n];
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> input[i];
    }
    
    int x;
    
    cin >> x;
    
    cout << lastIndex(input, n, x) << endl;

}
